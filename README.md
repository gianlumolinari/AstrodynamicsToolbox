# Astrodynamics Toolbox (MATLAB)

A modular MATLAB toolbox for **classical astrodynamics**, **trajectory design**, and **dynamical systems analysis in the Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem (CR3BP)**.

The project is under active development and is intended as a research-oriented environment for:

- orbit propagation and perturbation modeling
- Lambert and patched-conics trajectory design
- SPICE-based ephemerides and mission reconstruction
- multiple-gravity-assist analysis
- small-body target screening
- periodic orbit computation in the CR3BP
- family continuation, stability analysis, invariant manifolds, and Poincaré sections

---

## Current Scope

The toolbox currently develops along two main directions:

### 1. Classical astrodynamics
Classical trajectory-analysis capabilities include:

- Cartesian / orbital-element conversions
- two-body propagation
- Lambert solvers
- Hohmann and patched-conics transfers
- J2, drag, and third-body perturbations
- topocentric visibility and ground-station access
- eclipse and conical shadow checks
- multiple-gravity-assist workflows
- SPICE-based mission reconstruction and validation
- small-body / NEO screening examples

### 2. CR3BP and dynamical systems
CR3BP capabilities include:

- equations of motion and zero-velocity curves
- Lagrange point computation
- JPL periodic-orbit seed retrieval
- planar Lyapunov and halo differential correction
- single-shooting and multiple-shooting correction
- natural and pseudo-arclength continuation
- family generation and visualization
- monodromy matrix and eigenspectrum analysis
- stability diagnostics
- stable and unstable manifold generation
- Poincaré sections
- validation against literature benchmarks such as Howell (1984)

Validation Strategy

A core design goal of the toolbox is benchmark consistency.

Validation workflows currently include comparison against:
	- SPICE truth trajectories for mission reconstruction examples
	- JPL periodic-orbit seeds for CR3BP family studies
	- literature benchmarks such as Howell (1984) for halo orbits

This makes the toolbox useful not only for development and exploration, but also for reproducible astrodynamics studies.

⸻

Development Status

This is an ongoing project.

The current focus is on building a robust and extensible foundation for:
	- classical mission design workflows
	- CR3BP periodic orbit computation and continuation
	- invariant manifold analysis
	- benchmark validation against literature and ephemerides

Planned future directions include:
	- more automated regression tests
	- additional optimization workflows
	- improved manifold-surface visualization
	- expanded small-body targeting tools
	- higher-fidelity models beyond the CR3BP

⸻

Design Principles

The toolbox is being developed with the following priorities:
	- modularity — reusable functions under the +astro package
	- transparency — examples written as readable workflows rather than black boxes
	- validation — benchmark scripts included alongside development and demo cases
	- research utility — suitable for both learning and more advanced exploratory work

⸻

Notes
	- Most examples are written as transparent scripts to make the workflow easy to inspect and adapt.
	- Validation scripts are especially useful as reference cases when extending the toolbox.
	- The CR3BP branch is being developed with a strong emphasis on literature consistency and benchmark reproducibility.
	- Some visualizations, especially invariant-manifold plots, may continue to evolve as benchmark cases and plotting conventions are refined.
